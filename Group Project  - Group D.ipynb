Comments<br> <br>\nAs expected, many created variables are derived from others and therefore have a strong linear relationship. If keeping them, we would risk high multicolinearity, hurting the model, computational power and eventually even prediction results. Variables very close to each other, or redundant ones - such as drop out rate (w/ formula as 1 - conversion rate), should be extracted.\n\nInstead of manually chosing all the highly correlated variables to extract from the final dataframe, in the next cells we go with the principal component analysis instead. This should ensure the best features' selection while keeping the most information needed for the modeling. We hope to go with around 10 to 14 PCA components (features)."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"8caac37a-3bd9-4a14-bb9b-197c2a7043bf"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 3 -
